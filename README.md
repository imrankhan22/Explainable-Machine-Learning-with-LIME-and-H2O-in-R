# Explainable-Machine-Learning-with-LIME-and-H2O-in-R
The hands on project on Explainable Machine Learning with LIME and H2O in R is divided into following tasks:  
In this Project, I have learn three objectives,
1.	Use the LIME and H2O for automatic and interpretable machine learning
2.	Build Classification Models with AutoML
3.	Explain and Interpret the Model Predictions using LIME 
This is a hands-on, guided project on Explainable Machine Learning with LIME and H2O in R on Coursera. In this project, I have generate a machine learning model using a sample HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset from IBM and explore some of the most popular ways to interpret a generated machine learning model using LIME and H2O.LIME is an algorithm that can explain the predictions of any classifier or regressor , by approximating it locally with an interpretable model. Interpretable explanations means that we are able to understand what the model does and which features it picks in order to create predictions.
